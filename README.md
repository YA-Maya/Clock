# Clock
As part of my efforts to improve my JavaScript skills, I developed a clock that challenged me to master rotating the hands. Along the way, I had a lot of fun discovering new techniques and tackling various obstacles. Through it all, I gained a deeper understanding of important concepts like setRotation and the 60000 milliseconds in a minute. Overall, it was a rewarding and enjoyable experience that helped me grow as a developer!
